This is a fork of the original Nedaa prayer app, focused on a new vision: making prayer logging effortless and automatic.


The Vision: A Smart Prayer Log
Our goal is to automatically log your prayers when you attend a mosque, without you having to do anything.

How It Works
Prayer Time Arrives: When the Athan sounds, the app wakes up for a short period.

Location Check: The app checks your location for the next few minutes.

Automatic Logging: If it detects you are near a mosque, it automatically marks that prayer as completed. If not, it does nothing.

Community-Powered Maps: This feature is powered by the free and open OpenStreetMap. If the app doesn't find your mosque, it's because it's not on the map yet. 

You'll have the chance to easily add it, improving the map for Muslims everywhere.

This automation respects your battery by only checking your location for a few minutes around each prayer time.
